# Performance Improvements

- Optimize bundle size by removing unused dependencies and splitting code with dynamic imports.
- Use React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders in frequently updated components.
- Lazy-load images and assets where possible.
- Profile and optimize slow rendering paths using React DevTools.
