# Code Quality & Structure Improvements

- Fix ESLint warnings (`react-refresh/only-export-components`) by moving non-component exports (constants, helpers) out of component files.
- Add more explicit TypeScript types to props, state, and hooks.
- Refactor large components into smaller, focused ones for better maintainability.
